	    <h1> Calling Elixir from Erlang </h1>
	      <p>I've been feeling inspired following Dave Thomas and Bruces Tate's
inspirational talk <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fklep3sUSWo'>We are blessed</a> that they gave at the <a href='http://www.erlang-factory.com/sfbay2016'>Erlang factory</a>
so I started playing ...
</p>
<p>Part of the lecture described how Dave had thrown out a challenge to Bruce -
&ldquo;Do something difficult in Elixir for a month&rdquo; then talk to be about it.
</p>
<p>Great I thought - I'll cross compile Erlang into Elixir and see what happens -
I mentioned this to Dave and somebody in the coffee queue overheard the
conversation and said it was impossible - to which I though &ldquo;even
better, when can I start.&rdquo; Attacking impossible problems is so much
more fun that attacking easy problems that you know you can solve.
</p>
<p>And as Alan Kay said - &ldquo;If you don't fail at least 90% of the time,
you're not aiming high enough.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Cross compilation is just a matter of diddling with parse trees, so it should
in be principle &ldquo;be easy&rdquo;
</p>
<blockquote>If a computer scientist says that something is easy in principle, it
  means it might be really really difficult in practice, but they
  don't know 'cos they haven't failed yet.
</blockquote>
<p>So wanted to mess with the parse trees representing Erlang programs
and Elixir programs. I know what Erlang parse trees look like and what
they mean, but what about Elixir?
</p>
<p>Specifically I wanted to parse an Elixir module, then turn the AST back to textual
representation and whap it into a file. Hopefully I'd get back what I started with.
</p>
<p>We'll see ...
</p>
<a name='head_1'></a><h1>Getting the parse tree</h1>
<p>So now I wanted to call Elixir from Erlang so that I could explore the goodness of
Elixir from Erlang, but ran into a tiny problem.
</p>
<p>Calling Erlang from Elixir is well documented but not the other way around.
</p>
<p>After  a little tinkering I found that I could parse an Elixir file like this:
</p>
<div class='pre'>{:ok, ast} = Code.string_to_quoted(File.read!("module.ex"))
</div>
<p>and turn the ast into a string with
</p>
<div class='pre'>Macro.to_string(ast)
</div>
<blockquote>With my Erlang hat on I thought the inverse of
<span class='code'>Code.string_to_quoted</span> would be <span class='code'>Code.quoted_to_string</span> <b>but I was wrong</b>
and the principle of least astonishment was violated again.
</blockquote>
<a name='head_2'></a><h1>Moving on...</h1>
<p>I now wanted to call <span class='code'>Code.string_to_quoted</span> and <span class='code'>File.read!</span> from
Erlang - so I ran into the - *where is this stuff* and *what is it
called* problem.
</p>
<a name='head_3'></a><h1>Where is my Elixir stuff and how can Erlang find it?</h1>
<p>I messed around a bit and figured out that Erlang could find my Elixir code if I made
a <span class='code'>.erlang</span> file with the following:
</p>
<div class='pre'>code:add_path("/usr/local/lib/elixir/lib/elixir/ebin/").
io:format("Elixir paths set~n").
</div>
<p>And whoopydo happy days are here again, Erlang knows where the Elixir code is.
</p>
<a name='head_4'></a><h1>What are the functions called?</h1>
<p>But what are the functions called? Well <span class='code'>File.read!</span> in Elixir is just
<span class='code'>'Elixir.File':'read!'</span> in Erlang. That was easy. So now I wrote the Erlang code:
</p>
<div class='pre'>test() ->
   X = 'Elixir.File':'read!'("module.ex"),
   Ast = 'Elixir.Code':string_to_quoted(X).
</div>
<p>Keeping my fingers crossed I ran this in the Erlang shell:
</p>
<div class='pre'>> test:test().
** exception error: bad argument
 in function  ets:lookup/2
    called as ets:lookup(elixir_config,compiler_options)
</div>
<p>Ouch. Whaaaat the $#@!!$%$#@#$$$$
</p>
<p>Ooops I've gotta set some stuff up. <b>How do I do this?</b>
</p>
<p>So Now what? I could:
</p>
<li>Google Google Google ... (boring)</li>
<li>Read the sources (deep sigh, do I really have to?) </li>
<li>Write a blog article and hope some kind person adds a comment telling me how to do this</li>
<p>In retrospect blogging and tweeting the blog is probably the fastest way to program.
I'll time it and see.
</p>
<p>Somebody out there knows how to do this, but I don't know who.
</p>
<blockquote>This is the big problem with software - probably all software we want
has already been written - but we can't find it so we do it ourselves.
</blockquote>
<p>Now I'm off for lunch - hopefully when I get back somebody will have solved
it.
</p>
<p>Have a nice one.
</p>
<a name='head_5'></a><h1>Added notes</h1>
<p>Yes - the experiment worked. By the time I'd got back from lunch, two
people had tweeted what to do. Both said &ldquo;start the Elixir application first.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>So I tried this:
</p>
<div class='pre'>> application:start(elixir).
{error,{not_started,compiler}}
</div>
<p>Not quite but getting warm: So yet another try:
</p>
<div class='pre'>1> application:start(compiler).
ok
2> application:start(elixir).  
ok
3> test:test().                
{ok,{defmodule,[{line,2}],
           [{'__aliases__',[{counter,0},{line,2}],['ModuleName']},
</div>
<div class='pre'>   ...
</div>
<p>The <span class='code'>...</span> above is because the shell output and the markdown
processor are not on speaking terms
and life is too short to wonder what:
</p>
<div class='pre'>Liquid Exception: Liquid syntax error: Variable ...
was not properly terminated with regexp:
</div>
<p>and 3 more lines of gibberish means.
</p>
<p>Not only does the mardown processor not do what I thought it should do
- but also the error message that it produces cannot be cut and paste into
this blog since this triggers the same error.
</p>
<p>Which leave me wondering just exactly how difficult is it to bonk a bit of verbatim
text into a web page. Parse the stuff - wrap it in a HTML <span class='code'>pre</span> tag and quote the
less than and ampersand characters.
</p>
<p>Life is full of surprises - and programming more so.
